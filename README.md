## Overview
My challenge is to built a result-and-summary card component. A person's result is to be shown in the left card while the overall summary of the quiz is to be shown on the right side. In the design, we also have a button which is designed for its linked state as well as for its hover state.

### The challenge

  The main challenge is to:

- To build out the results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
- Set an optimal layout for the interface depending on user device's screen size.
- Set appropriate behaviour for hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- To use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content
